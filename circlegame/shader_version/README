The set up:
   Make sure you have an include directory one level back containing
      Angel.h
      mat.h
      vec.h
      initShader.cpp
   If not, adjust your path to the Angel.h file in the circle_shader.cpp file.

Do a make clean first, here's how using my makefile
   make FN=circle_shader clean

Now, do a make as follows
   make FN=circle_shader

And to execute the code
   ./circle_shader 

use Q|q to quit at any time.
